### How to run test scripts
In order to run the test scripts you will need to clone this repo in your homework repo:
```
$ cd <your homework repo directory>
$ git clone https://github.com/viveksaka/PA3/edit/main/README.md
```

You can then run all the checks and tests by calling:
```
$ bash viveksaka/PA3/my-submission-check.sh all
$ bash viveksaka/PA3/my-submission-test.sh all
```

Or you can run an individual check or test by calling:
```
$ bash <path to viveksaka/PA3/my-submission-check.sh <check number>
$ bash <path to viveksaka/PA3/my-submission-test.sh <test number>
